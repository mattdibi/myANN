# myANN
My Artificial Neural Network.

I used this project to learn OpenCV basics and to have a better understanding of how an Artificial Neural Network works.
The network characteristics:
- Forward propagation
- Optimization: backpropagation algorithm w/ gradient descent

### Requirements
- cmake
- OpenCV

### Results
